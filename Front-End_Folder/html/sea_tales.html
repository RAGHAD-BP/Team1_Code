                <h2>Titanic</h2>
                <p>The largest passenger ship of its time hit an iceberg in the North Atlantic.
                     It was called “unsinkable,” but sank in less than three hours. Due to high speed,
                      ignoring ice warnings, and too few lifeboats, around 700 survived out of 2200. 
                      It became a symbol of human arrogance before the sea.</p>

                <p>A mysterious area in the Atlantic Ocean,

                     Despite scientists’ attempts to explain the phenomenon,
                      the incidents remain without clear answers. 
                      The Bermuda Triangle has become a symbol of mystery,

                    It has never been found, yet its story remained alive in books and legends.

                     In 1915, it was struck by a German torpedo and sank in only 18 minutes. 
                     Out of nearly 2,000 passengers, fewer than a third survived. 
                     It became a symbol of the fragility of civilians in wartime and of the sea’s destructive power when combined with fire.

                    Fishermen said it was the ocean’s way of guiding them home.
                     Only later did scientists explain that the glow comes from 
                     tiny creatures called bioluminescent plankton, lighting up 
                     whenever the waves move.</p>

                    because it resembles the Bermuda Triangle, where vessels and planes vanish without
                     a trace. It stands as a symbol of maritime mystery that science

                <p>In 2012, a massive cruise ship carrying more
                     than 4,000 people sailed near the coast of Italy.
                      Due to a navigation error, it struck rocks and capsized on its side.
                       It took many hours before the ship was fully evacuated,
                        and most passengers survived. Yet the incident remained a lesson
                         in the responsibility of leadership. It became a symbol that technology 
                         alone is never enough against a single human mistake.</p>

                <p>Heracleion was once a major Egyptian port over two thousand years ago.
                It thrived with trade and temples until earthquakes and land collapse dragged the city into the water.
                It sank completely and remained lost until divers rediscovered it in 2000.
                 A once-living city now rests quietly on the seafloor.</p>
